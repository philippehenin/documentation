Odoo electronic invoicing in Denmark
====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Denmark's regulatory standards.


Legal framework for e-invoicing in Denmark
==========================================

In Denmark, electronic invoicing is governed by the `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
mandating the use of e-invoicing for :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. Danish
public sector entities require invoices to be submitted through NemHandel, the national e-invoicing
platform, using the OIOUBL (a local version of :abbr:`UBL (Universal Business Language)` and XML)
format. Denmark is also a key member of the Peppol network, enabling streamlined, standardized, and
secure cross-border e-invoicing for transactions within the European Union. While e-invoicing is not
mandatory for B2B transactions, its adoption is growing as businesses seek greater efficiency and
compliance.
