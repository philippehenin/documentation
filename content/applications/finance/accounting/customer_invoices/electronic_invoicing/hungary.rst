====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Hungary's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Hungary
==========================================

In Hungary, businesses must adhere to electronic invoicing regulations designed to ensure secure,
authentic, and storable transactions. The primary legal framework is the `Hungarian VAT Act
(Act CXXVII of 2007) <file:///home/odoo/Downloads/VAT%20RULES%20FOR%20TRANSACTIONS%20OF%20SPECIAL%20TAXPAYERS%20(31.07.2024.).pdf>`_,
which mandates real-time reporting of invoices to the NAV Online invoice system, Hungary’s
government e-invoicing platform. As of 2021, all B2B and B2C invoices must be reported in real time,
regardless of value. Hungary’s regulations do not currently require
:abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` e-invoicing, but public sector invoicing is encouraged via the
Peppol network. Common formats for e-invoicing include XML for NAV submissions and other structured
formats to streamline compliance.
